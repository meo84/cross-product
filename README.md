#Simple program to do a cross product of two arrays

Given two same-sized arrays, one of values and one of indices,
it returns an array where the nth element is the product of all values from first array, except the value at index specified in the nth element of the second array.

- Run `bundle install`
- Run tests: `rspec`
- Use program: `ruby cli.rb [2,1,3,5] [1,2,0,3]`
